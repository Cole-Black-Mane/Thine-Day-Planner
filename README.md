(WIP) The functional task of this webapp is keep a day planner, by being able to save your written inputs within the console as well as the HTML itself when the user doesn't have thier dev tools opened up.
The save buttons do very much work, persisting the text that was written in the timeblocks, as well as console logging that data, keeping the hover function from the base code for classic style.
RED indicates the past hours, BLUE is current hour, then YELLOW is future time slots that are upcoming.
